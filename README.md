# Password-Generator

## Description

My motivation for this project was to finish building a password generator with the starter code I was given. I built this prjoect in order to learn on my own how to create an interactive password generator using JavaScript. The problem that this webpage solves is that it generates a unique password for users who want something completely random for their password. I learned how to use concat, the Math method, how to use NaN in an if statement, the usefulness of parseInt, and many more things.

## Usage

In order to use this webpage, click on the "Generate Password" button to begin. You'll be prompted with an assortment of questions to answer in order to configure your password. When all the questions have been answered, the display box will show a random password with the criteria given. You can click on the "Generate Password" again to start over if you would like to create a different password.
